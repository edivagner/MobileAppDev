Exercise 1 â€“ Video 3
For this exercise you are required to perform the following tasks:
- Define a number variable and assign a number to it.
- Implement a single selection if statement to check if the value assigned to the variable is
equal to 1.
    - Implement a single selection if statement to check if the value assigned to the variable is
greater than 1.
    - Implement a single selection if statement to check if the value assigned to the variable is
greater than or equal to 1.
    - Implement a single selection if statement to check if the value assigned to the variable is less
than 1.
    - Implement a single selection if statement to check if the value assigned to the variable is less
than or equal to 1.
    - Implement a single selection if statement to check if the value assigned to the variable is not
equal to 1.
If any of the conditions on the if statements evaluate to true just output a message to the console.
For example, if the value assigned to the number variable is 1, then the output on the screen should
be similar to the following:
Test the code to check you get the expected output when assigning a range of different values to the
variable.

var A = 20;
if (A == 1) {
    console.log("value assignet to variable is equal to 1");
}
if (A > 1) {
    console.log("value assigned to variable is greater than 1");
}
if (A >= 1) {
    console.log("value assigned to variable is greater than or equal to 1");
}
if (A < 1) {
    console.log("value assigned to variable is less than 1");
}
if (A <= 1) {
    console.log("value assigned to variable is less than or equal to 1");
}
if (A != 1) {
    console.log("value assignet to variable is not equal 1");
}
